# The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic optimization problem where the goal is to find the shortest possible route that visits every city exactly once and returns to the starting city. Here's a sample implementation of the TSP using Python:

import itertools
import math

def tsp(cities):
    # Generate all possible permutations of cities
    permutations = itertools.permutations(cities)
    
    # Initialize minimum distance and path
    min_distance = math.inf
    min_path = None
    
    # Iterate through all permutations and compute their distances
    for path in permutations:
        distance = 0
        for i in range(len(path) - 1):
            distance += math.dist(path[i], path[i+1])
        distance += math.dist(path[-1], path[0])
        
        # Update minimum distance and path if current distance is smaller
        if distance < min_distance:
            min_distance = distance
            min_path = path
    
    return min_distance, min_path

# Example usage
cities = [(0, 0), (1, 2), (3, 1), (5, 4)]
min_distance, min_path = tsp(cities)
print("Minimum distance:", min_distance)
print("Minimum path:", min_path)

#In the above code, the tsp function takes a list of cities represented as tuples of (x, y) coordinates, generates all possible permutations of the cities using itertools.permutations, and then iterates through each permutation to compute its distance. The distance between two cities is computed using the math.dist function, which calculates the Euclidean distance between two points. The minimum distance and path are updated as necessary, and finally returned at the end of the function.

#Note that the TSP is an NP-hard problem, meaning that the time complexity of this brute-force approach is O(n!), which quickly becomes impractical for large numbers of cities. There are more efficient algorithms for solving the TSP, such as the Christofides algorithm and the 2-opt algorithm, which can find near-optimal solutions in polynomial time.
